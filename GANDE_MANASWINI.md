 ## Report on Blockchain Protocols for IOT networks

**Title:** Blockchain Technologies for the Internet of Things:

**Name of Journal**:Blockchain Technologies for the Internet of things research issues and Challenges.

**Summary:**
IoT is being implemented successfully in social media, smart transportation system, smart city management and several other industries and factories. In both, the human centric and the machine centric network of IoTs attempts at creating symmetrical closed loops of multiple devices. However, there are the following problems connected with the processorsâ€™ limitations, amount and organization of the large volumes, the presence of which influences the functioning of the system.

## Core Components:

**1) Blocks:** A collection of blocks connected by hash values.

**2) Public Ledger:** It is peer-to-peer network that holds digitally signed transactions.

**3) Cryptographic keys:** 
- The public key enables encryption.
- Private keys are used to sign transactions.
