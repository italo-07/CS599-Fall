### New Mini-Moon??

I read a news article this morning from the __New York Times__ titled [_A New Mini-Moon Is Being Captured by Planet Earth_](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/science/new-mini-moon-earth-orbit.html) - which is a somewhat misleading title as we are not actually gaining a "new moon" nor is it even close to being moon sized. 

From roughly the end of September to the end of November, this new "mini-moon" (which is actually just a small asteroid called **2024 PT5**) will be captured by Earth's gravity, complete a partial orbit around the Earth, and begin a new trajectory into space.

One of the interesting things about this asteroid in particular is its origin. From the article:
> The asteroid's past motion suggests that it's "possible a piece of ejecta from an impact on the moon," said Paul Chodas, the director of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA's Jet Propulsion Labratory.
This means it could likely be a small piece of the original collision that formed our Moon.

### Not actually...

The article also discusses two related topics, which asteroid 2024 PT5 doesn't really qualify for:
1. Asteroid mining (for precious metals), which generally occurs with mini-moons because they are easily accessible due to being in orbit around the Earth, at least for a short period of time.

    Asteroid 2024 PT5 is not really a mini-moon because it wont complete 1 full orbit around the Earth - its orbit is more horseshoe-shaped. 
4. Planetary defense researchers are interested in any asteroids that come close to the Earth, because some of them could pose significant threats to the Earth if they were to hit it.
     
     Asteroid 2024 PT5 is too small for this though. It is onl 33 feet long, and the asteroids that concern planetary defense researchers are closer to 460 feet across as they would be capable of destroying entire cities.


In the end, it really is just cool to see these kinds of things in effect, because they don't happen very often. Usually, asteroids are too big, too fast, or just simply not in quite the right spot to be caught by our gravity, and then just pass us by. Some may enter the atmosphere, but usually those that do are so small that they burn up on entry. Identifying and studying the asteroids that don't fit into one of the previous two categories is important, and very interesting!
