##1. Introduction
The advent of social media has significantly altered human communication and social interaction. This qualitative study by Mehmet Emin Aksoy investigates the underlying reasons for social media addiction among university students who identify as addicted to social media. The study provides insights into the motivations and phases of social media use and addiction.

##2. Objectives
The primary objective of this research was to elucidate the causes of social media addiction from the perspective of individuals who perceive themselves as social media addicts. By analyzing these reasons, the study aims to offer a clearer and more concrete understanding of social media addiction.

##3. Methodology
3.1. Participants
The study involved 25 university students from Gaziosmanpasa University, selected based on their self-reported addiction to social media. Among the participants, 12 were male and 13 were female.

3.2. Data Collection
Data were collected through:

Addiction Tests: Participants were initially screened for social media addiction.
Qualitative Interviews: Participants answered a set of five open-ended questions via email, focusing on their social media use, purposes, and changes over time.
Document Analysis: The study also examined participants' social media activities and related documents.
3.3. Data Analysis
The collected data were analyzed qualitatively. Responses were categorized into themes and coded to identify common patterns and reasons behind social media addiction.

##4. Findings
4.1. Reasons for Using Social Media
Participants identified several key reasons for their social media use:

Lack of Friends: The predominant reason cited was a lack of real-life friends, driving the initial engagement with social media.
Social Necessity: Many participants viewed social media as a necessary tool for social interaction and staying connected.
Feeling of Fulfillment: Social media provided a sense of accomplishment and duty for some users.
Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): Participants used social media to keep up with current events and avoid feeling out of the loop.
Integration into Daily Life: Social media had become intertwined with daily routines, making it a habitual activity.
4.2. Phases of Social Media Addiction
The study identified two distinct phases of social media addiction:

Beginning Phase: Characterized by initial engagement due to unmet social needs, lack of social interaction, and boredom.
Continuity Phase: Marked by deeper integration into daily life, where social media use becomes a routine activity for staying informed and managing social connections.
4.3. Gender Differences
Male Participants: More inclined towards making new friends through social media.
Female Participants: Focused on maintaining and communicating with existing real-life friends.
4.4. Long-Term Use and Attitudes
Most participants expressed a reluctance to give up social media, citing its integral role in their lives and its perceived benefits. They felt social media contributed positively to their personal development and social interactions.

##5. Discussion
The study highlights the complex motivations behind social media addiction. Initially driven by social deficits and boredom, social media use evolves into a more entrenched part of daily life. The findings suggest that social media addiction develops in phases, from initial engagement to continuous, habitual use. The research underscores the role of social media in fulfilling social needs and keeping users engaged with current events.

Gender differences in social media use also emerged, with males seeking new social connections and females focusing on existing relationships. These insights align with previous research, demonstrating that while the core reasons for social media use are consistent, individual experiences and motivations can vary.

##6. Conclusion
The research provides a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind social media addiction among university students. It illustrates the transition from initial engagement due to social needs to a more integrated and habitual use of social media. The study's findings contribute to the broader discourse on social media addiction, highlighting both its benefits and potential for addiction.

##7. Recommendations
Based on the study's findings, the following recommendations are made:

Awareness Programs: Institutions should implement programs to raise awareness about the risks of social media addiction and promote balanced usage.
Support Services: Provide support services for individuals struggling with social media addiction, focusing on managing and moderating their usage.
Further Research: Conduct additional research to explore the long-term effects of social media addiction and develop targeted interventions.
