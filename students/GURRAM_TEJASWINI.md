### Summary
- **Aurora** is a Python package for estimating electromagnetic transfer functions (TFs) using magnetotelluric (MT) data.
+ It leverages existing packages like **MTH5** and **mt_metadata** to simplify data processing workflows.
* The package allows for the management and editing of data inputs and parameters through Pandas dataframes and JSON configuration files.
- Aurora is designed to improve ease of use and readability compared to older FORTRAN-based MT processing codes.
+ The software is part of a growing ecosystem of open-source tools for geophysical data analysis.
