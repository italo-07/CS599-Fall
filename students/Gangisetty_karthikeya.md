Former U.S. President Donald Trump and Kamala Harris faced each other on the debate stage Tuesday (September 10, 2024) night for the first — and possibly the last — time.The exchange set the tone for the 90-minute debate to come: Ms. Harris controlled the conversation at times, baiting Mr. Trump with jabs at his economic policy, his refusal to concede his 2020 election loss, and even his performance at his rallies.

**Mr. Trump, while measured early on, grew more annoyed as the night went on. One significant moment played out after the two candidates left the stage, `when megastar Taylor Swift said she'll vote for Ms. Harris.`**

In her first answer, the former prosecutor said Mr. Trump’s tariffs would effectively create a sales tax on the middle class. She soon accused Mr. Trump of presiding over the worst attack on American democracy since the Civil War — the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. She charged him with telling women what they could do with their bodies. And she mocked Mr. Trump’s praise of dictators “who would eat you for lunch.”
“You did in fact lose that election,” Ms. Harris said of the 2020 race that Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden but still insists he won. “Donald Trump was fired by 81 million people,” she said, referring to Mr. Biden's winning vote total.

>But Ms. Harris may have got under her opponent’s skin the most when she went after his performance at his rallies, noting that people often leave early. Growing visibly irritated, Mr. Trump insisted that his rallies were larger than hers.

A smiling Ms. Harris frequently shifted her message from Mr. Trump back to the American people.
**“You will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams, and your needs and your desires,”** Ms. Harris said. “And I’ll tell you, I believe you deserve a President who actually puts you first.”
Mr. Trump was often on defense, but he did drive the core message of his campaign: inflation and immigration are hammering Americans.

Immigrants, Mr. Trump said, have “destroyed the fabric of our country.”
He repeatedly tied Ms. Harris to Mr. Biden.
“She is Biden,” he said.

**Ms. Harris responded, “Clearly, I am not Joe Biden and I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country.”
Mr. Trump also went after Ms. Harris for moving away from some of the progressive positions she took in the 2020 Democratic Presidential primary, urging voters not to believe the more moderate tone she’s striking in this campaign.**

Mr. Trump tried to play down the matter. `“I don’t care what she is, you make a big deal out of something, I couldn’t care less,"` he said.

Ms. Harris, however, had her opening and she rattled off a long list of Trump’s racial controversies: his legal settlement for discrimination against prospective Black tenants at his New York apartment buildings in the 1970s; his ad calling for the execution of Black and Latino teenagers — who were wrongly arrested — in the Central Park jogger case in the 1980s; and his false claims that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States.

**“I think the American people want something better than that, want better than this,” she said.**

Mr. Trump amplified false rumors that Haitian immigrants in Ohio are eating pets — ABC's Muir noted that local officials say that is not happening — as he argued that the Biden-Harris administration was admitting dangerous immigrants.

When Harris pressed him on the array of criminal and civil cases against him, Trump similarly fumed. He accused Harris and Biden of planting all the cases.

>“I probably took a bullet to the head because of the things they said about me,” Mr. Trump said, referencing the assassination attempt in July by a gunman whose motives are unknown.

Mr. Trump said people look back on his presidency’s economy fondly. “I created one of the greatest economies in the history of our country,” he said. Harris flatly told viewers: “Donald Trump has no plan for you.”

Americans are slightly more likely to trust Trump over Harris when it comes to handling the economy, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs poll from August.\
Ms. Harris would be the nation’s first female president. But her gender was an afterthought during the debate.
She made no references to the historic nature of her candidacy. Neither did Trump.

And there were no performative moments in which gender was an issue. Who could forget Trump’s decision to stand behind his last female opponent, Hillary Clinton, during a 2016 debate? He also called Clinton a “nasty woman.” Afterward, Clinton said she was creeped out.
But on Tuesday night, both candidates stayed behind their podiums as instructed and there were no explicit jabs regarding gender.
