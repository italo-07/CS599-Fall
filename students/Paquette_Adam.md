# [NASA Cancels Viper Mission](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-ends-viper-project-continues-moon-exploration/)

### Article From NASA

After some internal review at NASA, the agency has decided to **cancel** the planned mission to the Moon to explore for
water along the Moons poles. The cancellation was a result of a delayed mission timeline and preventing further costs to 
the agency. 

Originally, the rover was slated to launch in late 2023 but was delayed until late 2024. The mission recieved another delay to launch in September 2025.
Facing growing costs and further potential delay, NASA decided to cancel the mission and reuse the instruments for future Moon exploration missions.

While this is a blow to further Moon exploration NASA is continuing to work with [CLPS](https://www.nasa.gov/commercial-lunar-payload-services/) 
(Commercial Lunar Payload Services) and other planned mission such as Artemis to continue lunar exploration.
