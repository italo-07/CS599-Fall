## Report

The paper introduces **Mnemonic**, a new system for *efficient parallel subgraph matching* in *streaming graphs*. As data streams become increasingly prevalent in various areas of life, including social networks, financial systems, and communication systems, the need to search for subgraph patterns in such inherently dynamic data becomes critical. Current state-of-the-art approaches for subgraph matching struggle with both scalability and the dynamic nature of large, streaming datasets.

**Mnemonic** addresses these challenges by:

1. Comparing *parallelism methods* for processing large graph streams.
2. Applying *modern algorithms* to minimize computational time.
3. Focusing on *incremental updates*, allowing the system to respond to changes in real-time instead of recomputing everything from scratch.

The experimental results demonstrate that **Mnemonic** is significantly more efficient than previous approaches in terms of both speed and scalability, making it an effective solution for real-time subgraph matching in large-scale applications.

From the standpoint of graph processing and parallel computing, this paper presents a *state-of-the-art* solution to a critical problem in todayâ€™s data systems.
