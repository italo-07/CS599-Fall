## *Report*
This report discusses two significent devlopments in the tech world:
- **GitHub's announcement of extending Copilot with third-party skills**
- **Exploitation of GitHub an dFileZilla for malware distribution.**
## ***GitHub's announcement of extending Copilot with third-party skills:***
- With more customization options and interaction with outside tools and services, GitHub's latest version to Copilot, known as GitHub Copilot Chat or the Copilot Extension, aims to improve the developer experience.
- With the update, developers can now create, access, and utilize third-party "skills" from Microsoft Azure, Docker, DataStax, and other platforms.
- More integrations are probably on the horizon.
- The main objective of this upgrade is to incorporate Copilot with a higher level of intelligence, speeding up program development.
### *Integrities with Third Parties*
- **DataStax**: Make use of data management features to make it easier for developers to interact with databases, especially when working with real-time data.
  With Docker, developers don't need to leave their coding environment to automate container-related operations like creating, managing, and deploying containerized apps.
- **Microsoft Azure**: Developers may use their code editor to manage cloud resources, launch apps, and communicate with Azure services thanks to integration with cloud services.
### *Enhanced Strengths of AI*
- The AI in Copilot is being enhanced to carry out increasingly sophisticated and intelligent activities, accelerating the coding and problem-solving process by automating repetitive operations
  and suggesting context-aware snippets.
- In order to receive more individualized code recommendations, developers can also train the Copilot model to better suit their unique development environment or workflow.
### *Customization of Skills*:
- GitHub With its more adaptability, Copilot now lets developers add "skills" to customize and expand its functionality to meet project-specific needs.
- This customization may take the form of task-specific help, customized code development, or process automation.
- Copilot may now function as a more intelligent assistant by adjusting to various programming environments and frameworks thanks to these "skills".
### *Exploitation of GitHub and FileZilla for malware distribution:*
- Hackers have been using FileZilla and GitHub to distribute malware.
- The hacker collective GitCaught is infiltrating legitimate marketplaces with financial software thieves and pirateware.
- It demonstrates how risky it is to be free and how important it is for us to take cyber security seriously in the present world.
