I structured the report by providing a brief summary of the artcile and my opinion on the contents of the article. I hope you enjoy. 

### Article Summary
The Iowa Department of Education invested $3 million dollars for an AI tutor called EPS Reading Assistant. This is a statewide rollout that will allow for the AI tutor to be incorporated into more than 40 elementary schools with no cost to the school through summer 2025.

The main goal is to provide more support for student literacy. The AI will be helpful to student by listening to them as they read out loud. As the student reads, the digial avatar named Amira will listen and assess the student. The avatar will provide correct the students should they make a mistake. 

The AI tutor was created in collaboration between Amira learning and EPS Learning. 


### My Opinion
I like what the Iowa Department of Education has done. I think it is really honorable to invest in the education of educates. I love that AI is not being used to destroy the development of children, but strengthen the development. This is trully an excellent investment.
