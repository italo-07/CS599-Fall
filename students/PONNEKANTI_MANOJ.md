## Overview

OpenAI recently released its new ChatGPT o1 models, marking a significant update in the AI landscape. The o1 models, codenamed “Strawberry” internally, promise advanced reasoning capabilities by pausing to “think” before answering. However, despite the hype, the improvements are mixed.

## Key Points

**1. Model Performance:**
- ChatGPT o1 excels at complex reasoning tasks but is roughly four times more expensive to use compared to its predecessor, GPT-4o.
- It lacks some of the tools and speed that made GPT-4o impressive, and OpenAI acknowledges that GPT-4o remains superior for simpler tasks.

**2. Cost Considerations:**
- The new model introduces additional "reasoning tokens" which add to the cost, making it more expensive for general use.

**3. Practical Applications:**
- The model shows promise in handling complex queries, such as planning events or breaking down large tasks.
- However, it tends to overthink simpler questions, providing more detail than necessary.

## Thoughts

The introduction of ChatGPT o1 highlights a step forward in AI reasoning but also underscores the limitations and costs associated with cutting-edge technology. As noted by experts like Ravid Shwartz Ziv and Workera CEO Kian Katanforoosh, while o1's multi-step reasoning is groundbreaking, its practical benefits are nuanced and come with a hefty price tag.
