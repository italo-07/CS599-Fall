## Summary 
The paper investigates the demand and the use of Open Source Software(OSS) in various industries. With the growing reliance of the OSS, it has become important for the industries to establish the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) 
in order to manage the Open source resource in a more responsible way. The paper highlights the key objectives of OSPO, which help the industries streamline OSS management and maximize its potential. 
 
## Components of the OSPO
The authors of the paper have taken two case companies in order to explain the key points of OSPO. The case company A interviewee had an experience of 15 years in managing the company's OSPO, and company B has come across
the OSS through Linux and is now creating the company's OSPO because of increased dependency on the Open Source. 
 
1. **Intake:** The open source license is straight-forward and non-negotiable, i.e., one needs to comply with the terms in order to use it. This process involves ensuring that the OSS is licensed under acceptable terms and
and there is no Intellectual Property Risk that could pose a harm to the project. The OSPO helps in ensuring that the intake criteria are met, if necessary, provides alternatives, and maintains the record of software intake. Company
A has a centralized supervised method, while company B is decentralized as it is related to Linux.
2. **Compliance:** The open source compliance ensures that all terms and conditions are met through the development process and during code distribution. The important part is that the compliance checks are conducted.
regularly.  At the initial stage, it is important as it can help to avoid any legal implication or costly redesigns at the later stage. In order to manage these efficiently, the software architect integrates the auditing tool.
with the development toolchain. This helps them to conduct tests more regularly, sometimes twice a day, significantly reducing the cost and the efforts for the compliance work. Company A has an elaborate process for ensuring the
Compliance while in Company B involves Intellectual Property Rights Department.
3. **Distribution:** Distribution involves ensuring that the software being launched to the public adheres to the legal requirements, which can be making the source code public, copyright attribution, and permission notice with the
distribution code.  The actual publication is managed by the developers of both the companies involved. The OSPO supervises the distribution process and handles inquiries about noncompliance issues in coordination with the
legal department.  The company A is releasing software regularly, while company B is using Github to promote the use of Analytics business in cameras.
4. **Contribution:** The contribution is divided into three types: Trivial contributions refer to the minor bug fixes; Medium Contributions means to include new features or some significant architectural changes; and Major
Contribution involves substantial coding effort with significant values. The OSPO is responsible for educating engineers to encourage them to contribute to the development and serve as a liaison to the OSS community.
5. **Business Driven:** This was explained by taking the example of Company A. The company A categories its open source business model in three parts:
    1. ***Indirect Business Model:*** It refers to the smartphone market where the cost of the open software is fulfilled by the premium hardware cost.
    2. ***Extended Business Model:*** This means charging for services related to open source offerings.
    3. ***Asymmetric Business Model:*** The software is offered free to support an unrelated business.
  The OSPO supports the creation of these ecosystem building blocks, facilitating the development and the growth of these business models.
6. **Community:** The community opens the company to the independent developers, allowing them to influence and inspire the software development. This helps to attract talented developers to the employers. The company A
   has a wide set of developer communities, while Company B has only closed developer programs.
7. **Platform and Tools:** The platform enables the companies and the partners to explore new digital services and specialized functions, facilitating alternative business models. The platform development is benefited from
collaborative requirement management and drives open source product innovation.
8. **Services:** Providing professional service is part of offering a platform. The company A had limited resources for this and is driven by external providers who eventually contribute to the platform. In company B,
It is shared only among the company's developers.
9. **MarketPlace:** It is important to promote and sell these services to the users through a platform. The company A has not yet initiated such a thing, and the same goes for company B.
10. **Industry Collaboration:** If the platform succeeds both technically and professionally, it will pose a challenge for the proprietary solutions. The advantages of the Open Source like new business models and support
from the developer community could become a challenge for the closed source companies. Company A has been participating in the established ones, while company B has collaboration with partners of their choice.
11. **Ecosystem:** The OSS ecosystem can become the primary driver of the business through new and alternative revenue streams as it can encourage strong players to contribute to the community. Both companies have not
yet established this.
 
## Conclusion
With OSS becoming central to the development of the product and services, OSPO is critical for companies to gain and maintain a competitive edge. The study provides guidelines for achieving success in OSS engagement.
from compliance to building models around open source.The important OSPO components help to gain maturity in the use of OSS. The company A was slightly ahead of the B in taking new initiatives to build new business around OSS.
