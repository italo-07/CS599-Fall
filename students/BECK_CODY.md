## [All you need to know about model predictive control for buildings](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367578820300584)

This is a paper all about using *model predictive control* (**MPC**) in the control of building HVAC units.
It was published in 2020 in the journal [Annual Reviews in Control](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/annual-reviews-in-control).
The paper lists how to model the dynamics of buildings, such as the envelope mode, HVAC models, and disturbance models. It then
goes into detail about how to setup MPC problems to ensure that the temperature of the building stays within desired thermal comfort
levels while also minimizing energy usage.
